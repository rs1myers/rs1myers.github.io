In her review of a book by Henry Cowles on the history of the scientific method,(1) (1)Henry M. Cowles, The Scientific Method: An Evolution of Thinking from Darwin to Dewey Jessica Riskin recounts that the word “scientist” was coined in 1834 as a joke by William Whewell in his “excruciatingly patronizing” review of Mary Somerville’s book On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The most important and exceedingly difficult task of our time is to work on the construction of a new idea of reality.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;mdash; Wolfgang Pauli
Is the world, reality, very, very different from what most of us have been taught through modern science? Could non-physical properties (mind, spirit, or other)(1) (1)Provisionally interchangeable terms include mind, spirit, Tao, be as fundamental as charge or mass? Can ancient traditions and mystical perspectives contribute to a more complete picture of the way the universe really is than our current physicalist conception?</description>

      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;classical worldview&amp;rdquo; is broadly used to describe the scientific description of the world that began with Greek philosophers and reached its zenith in the 19th century. It was conceived 2,500 years ago as a rational replacement of myths about gods who controlled the world by imposing their whims through acts of nature they caused. As Morris Kline put it:
&amp;ldquo;The Greek intellectuals adopted a totally new attitude toward nature.</description>

      <description>A.H. Maslow coined a number of terms that have come into common parlance beyond academic psychology , including &amp;ldquo;hierarchy of needs&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;self-actualization&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;peak experience&amp;rdquo;. In his last book, The Farther Reaches of Human Nature, Maslow uses the term &amp;ldquo;full humanness&amp;rdquo; to describe psychologically healthy and mature people&amp;ndash; those who are self-actualized and beyond. But what defines a self-actualized person? And what lies beyond self-actualization?
Maslow understood the inherent difficulty of explicitly answering such subjective questions.</description>

      <description>“There is potential in fusion to revolutionize our world and to change all of the options that are in front of us and provide the world with abundant and clean energy without the harmful emissions of traditional energy sources.”
Hopes that fusion power will save us from the looming crises of global warming appear to be even stronger now than they were in 1954 when Lewis Strauss— then chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, and in apparent reference to fusion power— infamously declared that nuclear power would one day be too cheap to meter.</description>

      <description>Thomas Nagel is a leading and articulate critic of reductionist materialism, the dominant worldview in modern secular society. In his 2012 Mind &amp;amp; Cosmos: Why the Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature is Almost Certainly Wrong, Nagel argues that we need a new, radically different narrative from the dominant scientistic worldview of reductive materialism, contrasting it against theism. Although he takes a relatively broad brush to the concept of theism, he acknowledges that belief in God as fundamental to the universe remains a major alternative to the materialist worldview.</description>
