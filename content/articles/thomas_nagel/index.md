Thomas Nagel is a leading and articulate critic of reductionist materialism, the dominant worldview in modern secular society. In his 2012 *Mind & Cosmos: Why the Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature is Almost Certainly Wrong*, Nagel argues that we need a new, radically different narrative from the dominant scientistic worldview of reductive materialism, contrasting it against theism. Although he takes a relatively broad brush to the concept of theism, he acknowledges that belief in God as fundamental to the universe remains a major alternative to the materialist worldview. Nagel provides a more thorough summary of reductive materialism, the presumption of a purely physical universe that can best be described by examining its smallest pieces, focusing particularly on its biological application through the Neo-Darwinian model—also known as the Modern Synthesis. But neither alternative, he argues, is capable of adequately explaining the vast territory of consciousness and subjective phenomena.

Nagel does not advocate a specific alternative to these worldviews. Indeed, he holds that we not only do not presently have such an alternative, but we may not yet possess the conceptual tools necessary to even comprehend possible candidates. Nonetheless, he maintains that the prevailing conceptions are inadequate for a full understanding of reality.

Nagel has had such a new world view in his sights for decades, and in
*Mind and Cosmos* makes a compelling case that not only do we not
understand the true nature of reality, we may not currently possess the
basic stuff required to even begin comprehending it. Nagel's essay is
remarkably tight for covering the ground he does, and excerpts cannot do
justice to his work. Anyone interested in the idea that neither
materialism nor theism are sufficient accounts of how the world works
should read the entire book. In the meantime, a few excerpts may provide
even greater incentive for doing so:

> "It may be frustrating to acknowledge, but we are simply at the point
> in the history of human thought at which we find ourselves, and our
> successors will make discoveries and develop forms of understanding of
> which we have not even dreamt. Humans are addicted to the hope for a
> final reckoning, but intellectual humility requires that we resist the
> temptation to assume that the tools of the kind wee now have are in
> principle sufficient to understand the universe as a whole."

Nagel's target is the presumption of reductive materialism--- widely
held by almost all contemporary scientists and philosophers--- which
holds that an ultimate explanation of everything in the universe can be
reached, at least in principle, through physics, chemistry, and biology.

> reasons to be skeptical about the truth of reductionism in biology.

    seems to convince practically everyone."\]{{< /sidenote >}}

Nagel acknowledges that deep skepticism about reductive materialism can
reasonably be held even in the absence of a well-developed alternative.
He argues that neither advocates nor challengers of the materialist
perspective presently have a coherent and compelling argument in favor
of their position.

Nagel argues that not only is there little reason to believe that a
mechanistic account of the world has a reasonable probability of being
true, it may be that we may do not even possess the "basic tools needed
to understand" what the world is really like, particularly given the
essentially religious orthodoxy of contemporary science and philosophy:

Counter to the prevailing scientific orthodoxy though it may be, some of
us do not believe that the incredible complexity and diversity of our
world is purely accidental, that another planet with conditions conducive to life similar to earth would face the same extremely improbable prospects of evolving any, let alone a multiplicity of, highly intelligent beings. That does not, however, suggest let alone require the intervention of a supernatural agent. There can be, indeed many of us believe that there is, an underlying and entirely natural cosmic principle that favors the evolution of sentient beings, of consciousness, a central theme of *Mind & Cosmos*:
