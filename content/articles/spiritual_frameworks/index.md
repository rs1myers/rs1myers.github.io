Is the world, reality, very, very different from what most of us have
been taught through modern science? Could non-physical properties (mind,
spirit, or other){{< sidenote >}}Provisionally interchangeable terms include mind, spirit, Tao,{{< /sidenote >}} be as fundamental as charge or mass? Can ancient
traditions and mystical perspectives contribute to a more complete
picture of the way the universe really is than our current physicalist
conception?

According to the scientific models, explanations and narratives that
dominate contemporary Western thought, the answer to these questions is
a resounding "No." The scientistic{{< sidenote >}}Insert scientistic intro. \*\*\*\*\*{{< /sidenote >}} worldview holds no place for
non-material{{< sidenote >}}The terms "physical" and "material" are used interchangeably here.{{< /sidenote >}} properties, presuming as it does that the entire
contents of the universe consists entirely and exclusively of physical
objects and the forces that affect them.

This project proceeds from the opposite presumption: that non-physical
properties are as fundamental as mass and charge, even if we have no
idea why that is--- or even the wherewithal to fully grasp such a
profoundly different conception. This alternative view of the world is
not new. It is in fact quite ancient, although it has been largely
ignored or derided for the last couple of centuries. But the advent of
quantum physics blurred the sharp line of hard physicalism (at least in
the view of some physicists and philosophers) and opened another window
to renewed interest in what could reasonably be characterized as a
mystical perspective. The crux of this is consciousness. We all have it
and we all use it,{{< sidenote >}}Albeit to widely varying degrees.{{< /sidenote >}} but we have no idea what it is. The 1989
[*International Dictionary of
Psychology*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_International_Dictionary_of_Psycholo/E8ksAAAAMAAJ?hl=en)
did not even try to define consciousness, saying simply that
"Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible
to specify what it is, what it does, or why it evolved. Nothing worth
reading has been written about it."{{< sidenote >}}The elusive nature of consciousness remains the same today,{{< /sidenote >}}

The conception of spirit or mind as fundamental to reality has been a
basic premise of mystical and religious traditions for millennia and was
a favored perspective in Western philosophy for the better part of two
centuries. But that conception was replaced by the physicalist
conception of reality that emerged in lockstep with the mechanical
worldview of the Scientific Revolution. For. Most of the last several
centuries, the scientific view has been that matters of mind were a
completely separate domain from the hard sciences (following Descartes'
mind/matter dualism)--- and that notions of spirit are pre-scientific
imaginations or superstitions.{{< sidenote >}}Over the past few decades the idea that mind, all subjective{{< /sidenote >}}

The physicalist presumption of mind as a secondary phenomenon has been
strongly challenged, however, by the advent of quantum physics.
Discoveries and conjectures related to the quantum nature of matter have
led some contemporary physicists and philosophers to conclude that
consciousness is an inextricable aspect of reality. Although many
scientists and philosophers, perhaps most, remain unconvinced{{< sidenote >}}But then the the idea of a moving Earth was considered absurd by{{< /sidenote >}}, the
idea of fundamental mind or consciousness can no longer be summarily
dismissed as non-scientific.

This project explores an emerging naturalist{{< sidenote >}}In contrast to a supernatural view wherein non-material entities{{< /sidenote >}} narrative about the
world in which mind/spirit is a core element of reality. This is not a
new narrative, it's long been at the core of many mystical, religious,
and philosophical perspectives. But over the last century, discoveries
and conjectures in quantum physics have provided scientific evidence
that appears to support some of its basic elements--- or, at the very
least, does not stand in clear opposition to them. There appears to be
sufficient reason to believe that qualitative aspects or dimensions are
as real as the measurable ones that most contemporary Western thinkers
take for granted as the only real constituents of reality.

My aim is to examine connections between what might appear to be a
disparate set of disciplines and perspectives: spiritual, philosophical
and esoteric traditions together with discoveries and conjectures of
modern physics and biology. I take as a given (albeit a matter of
belief) that spiritual dimensions are fundamental aspects of reality,
that spirit (or an equivalent term){{< sidenote >}}Provisionally interchangeable terms include spirit, Tao, Chi,{{< /sidenote >}} is no less real than matter. All
of this is in the hope of adding voice to an emerging worldview that
accommodates both our knowledge of science and our intuitive sense of
connectedness and spirit--- and a replacement for the spiritually
corrosive worldview of scientistic physicalism{{< sidenote >}}See "Physicalism" for a brief summary of this philosophical{{< /sidenote >}}

The basic story line is just this: 1) At bottom, our Universe{{< sidenote >}}With a nod to notions about the Multiverse or the Many Worlds{{< /sidenote >}}
consists of a single substance or principle, referred to here as the
One;{{< sidenote >}}The idea of a single, fundamental substance or principle--- known{{< /sidenote >}} 2) The world can be thought of, as a rough illustration and
within the limitations of words available in this context, as a
psychophysical continuum between what we traditionally think of as
physical and spiritual. The physical aspect of this continuum has become
well understood through science, but the psycho (mind/spirit) aspect
cannot be understood with the tools we currently p mind (spirit, or a
similar term){{< sidenote >}}Provisionally interchangeable terms include spirit, Tao, Chi,{{< /sidenote >}} is as fundamental as charge or mass consciousness is
ubiquitous, and humans are a latecomer to highly-intelligent species on
Earth.

More than a philosophical perspective or imaginary narrative, a premise
here is that the essence of this theme corresponds to the way the world
really is (the same claim as made by physicalists). It takes as a
starting point that the standard scientistic orthodoxy of a purely
material or physical universe is incomplete--- and simply wrong in its
presumption that consciousness and the vast spectrum of subjective or
experiential phenomena are exclusively derivatives of physical
processes.

We'll explore this story here through a mixture of ideas from Western
philosophies and esoteric traditions along with discoveries and
conjectures of modern science, particularly physics and biology.
Variants of idealism, panpsychism and others--- with a selective
sprinkling of principles from esoteric or occult perspectives--- fall
into the broader composite considered here.

It's important to acknowledges that efforts to tell this story are
hampered by our language, grounded as it is in an old, classical view of
the world. Just as the two-dimensional denizens of Edwin Abbey's
*Flatland* could neither describe nor conceive of the sphere that passed
through their world, the languages and basic conceptions of contemporary
Western civilization, with their roots in supernatural and physicalist
presumptions, can (at least for now) only provide relatively crude
approximations of what is shaping up to be a radically different
perspective of reality.

In the end, of course, this is a matter of belief, different only in
type from the prevailing scientistic commitment to physicalism: that
science is the only valid means of reaching truth about the Universe and
that everything (including consciousness and subjective phenomena) is
exclusively physical. ........This is, of course, a belief, no different
except in conclusion from the foundational premise of modern
neuroscience that all subjective phenomena such as mind or consciousness
are derivatives of purely physical processes. But it appears to offer a
much richer means of accommodating the immense spectrum of subjective
phenomena that collectively represent much of what it means to be
sentient--- and, more narrowly, human.
